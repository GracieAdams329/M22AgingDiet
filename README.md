## TERMINOLOGY:
**FLOW CELL:** the physical flow cell the library is run on  
**LIBRARY:** the prepared library of (usually) 12 barcodes (12 samples)  
**RUN:** the individual run on the Gridion - a new one starts when the library is first run on the flow cell, and extra runs will be added when the flow cell is cleaned and reloaded with library during the experiment 
 **BARCODE:** each individual sample within the library (usually 12 barcodes per library)
