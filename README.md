# ONT-RNASeq-Pipeline
Pipeline for analysis of whole transcriptome data generated using ONT's PCR-cDNA barcoding kits on the GridION (or PromethION).
Previously tracked/stored using Google Docs on the Simons Lab Google Drive/ONT Sequencing folder (up until 21/10/24).

## TERMINOLOGY:
**FLOW CELL:** the physical flow cell the library is run on.
**LIBRARY:** the prepared library of (usually) 12 barcodes (12 samples).
**RUN:** the individual sequencing run on the GridION - a new one starts when the library is first run on the flow cell and extra runs will be added when the flow cell is cleaned and reloaded with library during the experiment.
**BARCODE:** each individually barcoded sample within the library (usually 12 barcoded samples per library).
